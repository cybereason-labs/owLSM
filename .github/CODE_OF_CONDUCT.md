# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and maintainers pledge to make participation in our community as positive as possible. Unlike stack overflow, reddit or other open source projects owLSM will ensure a harassment-free experience for everyone.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment:

- Being respectful and inclusive in speech and actions
- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward others
- Being open to constructive feedback
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing gratitude for contributions

Examples of unacceptable behavior:

- Trolling, insulting, or derogatory comments
- Personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information without permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the project maintainers. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, including issues, pull requests, discussions, and any other communication channels related to the project.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org), version 2.1.
