# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in owLSM, please report it responsibly.

**Do not open a public issue for security vulnerabilities.**

Instead, please create a security advisory through GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature. This allows us to work on a fix before the vulnerability is publicly disclosed.

We appreciate your help in keeping owLSM secure!
